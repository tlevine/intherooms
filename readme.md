Scrape locations from here.

Questions
* Can we do without the additional meeting information for now
    (`/oa`, `/na`, &c. endpoints)? I think we need it.
* Can we do without the additional location information for now (`/locations`
    endpoint)? I think we don't need it; there often isn't any.)
* I think the MVP should not automatically update itself from In The Rooms;
    this will simplify the handling of errors.
* Are you fine with the resulting database being free and available to everyone
    in a convenient format?

I may request your help for writing test fixtures and for other less
specialized tasks.
